This project is a React application designed to provide users with a fun and interactive experience of reading random jokes. It consists of several components orchestrated together to create a seamless user journey. Let's break down the description:

**Components**:

1. **SplashScreen Component**:
   - Initially, users are greeted with a SplashScreen component displaying a logo.
   - Upon clicking anywhere on the splash screen, users transition to the next page.

2. **Joke Component**:
   - Formerly known as CategoryPage, this component has been simplified to just display a single joke at a time.
   - It features a button labeled "Click me".
   - When users click the button, a random joke is fetched from an external API.
   - The fetched joke, consisting of setup and punchline, is then displayed on the page.

3. **App Component**:
   - The main component orchestrating the flow of the application.
   - It manages the state of the application to determine which page to render.
   - Initially renders the SplashScreen component.
   - Upon interaction (clicking), transitions to the Joke component.

**Functionality**:

- The application leverages React's useState hook for managing state within components.
- It utilizes the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests to an external joke API (`https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`) to dynamically fetch jokes.
- CSS styling is applied to enhance the visual appeal of the application, including animations for the logo.
- Interaction with the application is straightforward, with users clicking to navigate through pages and fetch jokes.

Overall, this project offers a delightful user experience through its combination of React components, external API integration, and engaging design elements, making it a charming addition to any web-based entertainment collection.
