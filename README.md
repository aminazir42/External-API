<p>This project is a simple React application designed to provide users with a light-hearted experience of reading random jokes. It consists of three main components:

1. **SplashScreen Component:** 
   - This component displays a splash screen with a logo image.
   - It prompts users to proceed to the next page by clicking anywhere on the screen.
   - Upon clicking, it triggers a transition to the CategoryPage component.

2. **CategoryPage Component:** 
   - This component allows users to select a joke category by clicking a button.
   - Upon selecting a category, it fetches a random joke from the specified category using an API call.
   - It displays the fetched joke along with its setup and punchline.

3. **App Component:** 
   - This is the main component that manages the application's state and renders different pages based on the current state.
   - It initializes with the 'splash' page, displaying the SplashScreen component.
   - It transitions to the CategoryPage component when the user clicks on the splash screen.

The project utilizes React for building user interfaces, along with CSS for styling. It employs state management using React hooks such as useState. Additionally, it fetches data from an external API (`https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`) to dynamically populate the jokes. Overall, it provides users with a fun and interactive way to explore random jokes in various categories.</p>
